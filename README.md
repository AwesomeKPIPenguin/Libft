# Libft

My own library with re-coded base functions from **libc** and **string.h** mostly. Also, there is some useful additional functional (linked list, doubly linked list functions etc.)

## Installation and Usage

All you need is just run **make**

```
make
```

As usual, Makefile contains other standart rules: **clean**, **fclean**, **re**.

As a result, you will get **libft.a** library, which could be used as default static library.

Header file: **libft.h**
